#Introduction
*For the first time, I could actually visualize the program before I started coding and determine what code needed to be modified to change the service to meet the objectives of lab-08.  Although I did not know the exact code that needed to be written, I understood it in general terms before I started coding.

#What items do I still not understand or what gaps have I identified in my knowledge?
*I was really strong at using the browser debugging tool.  I am very weak at using debugging tools with node.  
*how to automate test when you have dynamically generated items like UUID?  We did a work around in GET test that required nested requests.  Not sure if that is a good solution.  
*how do you list multiple files under your 'test' task in mocha-gulp?  
*need more work with mocha gulp-mocha and chai.  Tests are not running properly from gulp file
