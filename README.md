#Shooters-Log API  

#Overview
* This API provides the necessary back-end infrastructure and functionality to create, save, and return data related to shooting matches.  
* Currently this data is collected on the firing line and noted on paper in one of the following: a score card, a detailed match data book, or a barrel-book.  Many times this data is collected once and then transferred manually to some or all of the three books mentioned above.     
* By providing this API and supporting infrastructure, we are hoping to encourage developers of both client applications and web applications to develop applications that can provide value to the shooting community and a source of income for themselves.   

****
#Current Version
* The current version of this program is designed to collect and return data that can be used to produce a scorecard for a National Rifle Association (NRA) Mid-Range High Power rifle match.

#Architecture

This API is structured on a Model View Control(MVC) framework.  The base technology is a Node.js server with the core node.http server module and a Mongo database.

Middleware:  
  * The express router middleware provides the base routing capability.  
  * A custom handle-errors module implements and extends the http-errors npm middleware package.  
  * An auth middleware module leverages both the bcrypt and node.crypto modules to provide user sign-up and user sign-in functionality.  
  * Mongoose npm module is used for interaction with the Mongo database

View:  Individual resources (user, match......) have dedicated router files located in the route folder. In addition to providing an interface to the complimentary controller files, these files also parse the json content in the incoming request (where applicable) and create and populate a req.body property using the nmp package parse-body. For details about the input and output of routes, see the Routes section below.

Control: Individual resources (user, match...) have dedicated controller files.  These files implement the 'control' function of the MVC model.  These files provide the interaction with the both the "model" elements (database and model):
  * model:  The controller files call the constructor methods in the "model" files to construct new resource objects in memory
  * mongoose:  The controller files leverage the required mongoose client module to create new schemas in the mongo database and to create new documents for the resources supported by this API. Currently supported resources include:  
    -user  
    -competition  
    -match  
    -shot

Model:  Individual resources (user, match...) have dedicated model files. These files provide the constructors and the mongoose schema creation syntax. For a detailed breakdown of models and the model properties, see the schema section below.
